# Build Rituals for Tiny Teams

Summary: How we keep releases boring even when the roadmap is not.

Small teams do not need heavyweight process, but they do need repeatable rituals.
Our rule is simple: every release starts with a checklist, ends with a short retro, and updates the changelog before merge.
When this loop is stable, velocity stops depending on memory or heroics. It becomes a system.
